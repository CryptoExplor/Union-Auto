### File Descriptions

- **`main.py`**: Initializes the bot, loads environment variables, and orchestrates the transfer process.
- **`union.py`**: Contains the `Union` class with methods for transaction execution, balance checks, and cross-chain instruction generation.
- **`ui.py`**: Provides logging functions (`logger_info`, `logger_success`, etc.) for a colorful terminal interface.
- **`utils.py`**: Utility functions for hex padding and data encoding used in transaction construction.
- **`.env.example`**: Template for the `.env` file to store private keys and addresses.
- **`.gitignore`**: Excludes sensitive files (e.g., `.env`, `*.pyc`) from version control.
- **`requirements.txt`**: Lists required Python packages for easy installation.

## Configuration

### Environment Variables
The `.env` file must include:
- `PRIVATE_KEY`: Your EVM-compatible private key (e.g., for Sepolia, Holesky, etc.).
- `XION_ADDRESS`: Your Xion Testnet address (e.g., `xion1...`).
- `BABYLON_ADDRESS`: Your Babylon Testnet address (e.g., `bbn1...`).

Example `.env`:
```env
PRIVATE_KEY=0x1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef
XION_ADDRESS=xion1exampleaddresshere
BABYLON_ADDRESS=bbn1exampleaddresshere
```

### Transaction Amounts
Default transaction amounts are set in `union.py` and can be modified:
```python
self.sepolia_amount = 0.0001  # ETH for Sepolia transfers
self.holesky_amount = 0.0001  # ETH for Holesky transfers
self.sei_amount = 0.01        # SEI for Sei transfers
self.corn_amount = 0.0000001  # BTCN for Bitcorn transfers
```

### Delay Between Transactions
Adjust the delay between transactions (in seconds) in `union.py`:
```python
self.min_delay = 1  # Minimum delay
self.max_delay = 1  # Maximum delay
```

### RPC Endpoints
The bot uses the following RPC URLs, which can be updated in `union.py` if needed:
```python
self.SEPOLIA_RPC_URL = "https://sepolia.drpc.org/"
self.HOLESKY_RPC_URL = "https://ethereum-holesky-rpc.publicnode.com/"
self.SEI_RPC_URL = "https://evm-rpc-testnet.sei-apis.com/"
self.CORN_RPC_URL = "https://21000001.rpc.thirdweb.com/"
```

## Troubleshooting

- **Error: `'SignedTransaction' object has no attribute 'raw_transaction'`**:
  - Ensure you‚Äôre using `web3.py` version 6.0.0 or higher:
    ```bash
    pip install --upgrade web3
    ```
  - The bot uses `rawTransaction` (correct for `web3.py` v6+). If using an older version, downgrade to `web3==5.31.4` or update the code to use `raw_transaction`.

- **Error: Insufficient Funds**:
  - Verify you have enough testnet tokens for the transaction amount and gas fees.
  - Obtain testnet tokens from faucets for Sepolia, Holesky, Sei, or Bitcorn.

- **Error: Invalid RPC**:
  - Check the RPC URLs in `union.py`. Replace with alternative endpoints if needed (e.g., Alchemy, Infura).
  - Ensure your internet connection is stable.

- **Error: Invalid Private Key or Address**:
  - Double-check the `.env` file for correct formatting and valid EVM private key, Xion, and Babylon addresses.

- **Transaction Fails or Reverts**:
  - Verify the `UCS03_ROUTER_ADDRESS` and contract ABI in `union.py`.
  - Check the Union Testnet documentation for any updates to contract addresses or parameters.

- **Need Help?**:
  - Join the official Union Testnet community (e.g., Discord or Telegram) for support.
  - Open an issue on this repository with detailed logs.
